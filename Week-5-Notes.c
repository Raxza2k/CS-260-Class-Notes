        Euler Tours/Tree Trarerjals
        What are they, and how are they usefull?
        The Euler tours is the tracing of the tree, visiting each node 3 times.
        1) Right side - Pre-order
        2) Left side - In-order
        3) Bottom - Post-order
        See a diagram of the tree functionally.
        //I see what it means when we say each node is visited three times.
        //However the descriptions are tedious, look at Cooper's notes.
